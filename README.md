#ParticleWorld

ParticleWorld is actually two classes: particle and world. Particle is a single particle, world is a collection of particles.

## Dependencies

Both classes are dependent on math and vector3dm (my own vector class found in another repo).

## Installation

## Usage
What I expect is that these will be used as base classes for more sophisticated systems. But out of the box, world will create a bunch of random particles and cause the to fall according to gravity while displaying them. 

## Contributing
Love to see what you build with this!
