!!! TODO
000 code to create random particles and put them in the world
001 code to "run" the world -- "run()" maybe
001 run sim
002 code to regularly display the world
002 display world
003 remember to intengrate pygmae into all this
004 physics
005 collision
006 create random particles
007 display one sim
008 detect collision
010 code to display particles in the world (display from one arbitrary side)
020 code to change the camera (top, bottom, left, right, front, back -- only 6 choices, all orthagonal)
100 code to display the camera from any angle
000 why do all my random particals have random accelerations (should all be zero vector)
110 next try to do 100 partcles and then try playing with colitions
120 firefly.com; they each pick a random goal and fly toward it (thus testing the brain) and then pick another.
130 add collisions to fireflys detect fireflies that collide and change their color
140 now we want fireflies to be larger or smaller, brighter or dimmer depending on how close they are to the "camera"
150 Now we want to be able to change the camera
