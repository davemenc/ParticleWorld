!!! TODO ParticleWorld
x everything is "rolling" off the right hand side of the screen!
000 aero acc is getting banged to zero; fix that and your pixies might fly!
100 check brain to make sure it's actually doing what's it's supposed to
101 check pixie motion to make sure it's moving on it's tracks; I don't understand why it's so fast
120	make collision the first thing but base it not on the location but on the location+velocity: WILL object hit sthis impulse?
121	collision should be called before collision avoidance 
122	collision avoidance and brain need to work together because both aare autonomous and hence need to add up to no more than the acc limit
260	in pixie brain should try not to overshoot
310	for each particle, colision should say which item is closest
330	collision avoidance should change vectors to avoid the closest item
340	collision avoidance is part of pixie
350	collision avoidance returns values in m/s
360	collision avoidance is called by impulse and added into acceleration
481	could collision routine add the closest neighbor to the particle? Sure be convenient and seems like we're already doing the owrk
500 add collisions to pixies detect pixies that collide and change their color
510 now we want pixies to be larger or smaller, brighter or dimmer depending on how close they are to the "camera"
514 change constraints to respect wall types
520	have gravity be mass based
520 Now we want to be able to change the camera
530 code to change the camera (top, bottom, left, right, front, back -- only 6 choices, all orthagonal)
540 code to display the camera from any angle
550 add some of this back into particle world (sizes, maybe collisions)
560 the particles can't draw themselves but they can return a 100x100 image which is then scaled and located
570 the world can take the particle image and scale it by one dimension and locate it based on another
580 the particle can give a list of images based on facing; since they depend on the POV, the world has to pick
590 design an animation system; the particle knows it but the world displays it.
600	find out how to set events and so how to set the quit event in pygame
999	earth moon version
x constraints aren't working! it gets way past 1000 in z but get_z returns 76! WRONG
x constraints should also constrain y & z position and also the r of velocity (20 is a nice number)
