!!! TODO
158 detect collision
160 code to change the camera (top, bottom, left, right, front, back -- only 6 choices, all orthagonal)
180 code to display the camera from any angle
120 firefly.py; they each pick a random goal and fly toward it (thus testing the brain) and then pick another.
130 add collisions to fireflys detect fireflies that collide and change their color
140 now we want fireflies to be larger or smaller, brighter or dimmer depending on how close they are to the "camera"
150 Now we want to be able to change the camera

x code to "run" the world -- "run()" maybe
x code to create random particles and put them in the world
x code to display particles in the world (display from one arbitrary side)
x code to regularly display the world
x collision
x create random particles
x display one sim
x display world
x next try to do 100 partcles and then try playing with colitions
x physics
x remember to intengrate pygmae into all this
x run sim
x why do all my random particles have random accelerations (should all be zero vector)
